/**
 * @file
 * @brief Real-Time IO Sensor API
 *
 * Each  RTIO Sensor acts as a pollable stream of buffers with a driver that
 * provides a way of deserializing the raw sensor data buffers into meaningful
 * values.
 *
 * Each RTIO Sensor is expected to output buffers containing sample sets (such
 * as 9 axis IMU data) in a device specific format understood by the driver.
 * Each driver must then implement the sensor reader api and functionality
 * to deserialize this stream of buffers into meaningful SI unit data. The
 * caller may request different numerical formats of this data.
 *
 * Sample sets may contain 0 or more sensor channel values. A sensor channel
 * is understood to be something like the X channel or Y channel of a
 * 3 dimensional accelerometer.
 *
 * A sample set may vary in what it contains, even in the same block.
 * Some devices allow for different sampling rates of different channels.
 *
 * It must be understood by the user of this API what devices they are using
 * and what channels may or may not be available at any given time.
 *
 * For each new rtio_block received from the sensor, an rtio_sensor_reader
 * should be re-initialized. This allows the driver to provide an optimal
 * reader for the rtio_block avoiding unnecessary branching when possible.
 *
 * *TODO* To start only 32bit floating point numerical formatted values are
 * provided. Q format values with scale factors would be very useful for
 * use with CMSIS DSP or many SoCs that do not contain FPUs. The reader
 * *should* provide simple ways of converting integer readings into
 * useful numerical formats in common functions.
